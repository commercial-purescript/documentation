# Reference guides

Reference guides are technical descriptions of the machinery and how to operate it. Reference guides have one job only: to describe. They are code-determined, because ultimately that's what they describe. They describe classes, functions, APIs, so they should list things like functions, fields, attributes and methods, and instruct how to use them.

Reference material is **information-oriented**. By all means technical reference can contain examples to illustrate usage, but it should not attempt to explain basic concepts, or how to achieve common tasks. It should be **austere and to the point**. The culinary analogy might be an encyclopedia article about an ingredient, describing its provenance, its behaviour, its chemical constituents, and how it can be cooked. Note that describing correct usage of software, which is technical reference, is not the same as showing how to use it to achieve a certain goal, which is how-to documentation.

For some developers, reference guides are the only kind of documentation they can imagine. They already understand their software, they know how to use it. All they can imagine that other people might need is technical information about it. Reference material tends to be written well. It can even, to some extent, be generated automatically, but this is never sufficient on its own.

## How to write good reference documentation

### Structure the documentation around the code

Give reference documentation the same structure as the codebase, so that the user can navigate both the code and the documentation for it at the same time. This will also help the maintainers see where reference documentation is missing or needs to be updated.

### Use consistent documentation style

In reference guides, structure, tone, and format must all be consistent - as consistent as those of an encyclopedia or dictionary.

### Do nothing but describe

The only job of technical reference is to clearly and completely describe something. Anything else, explanation, discussion, instruction, speculation, opinion, is not only a distraction, but will make it harder to use and maintain. Provide examples to illustrate the description when appropriate.

Avoid the temptation to use reference material to instruct in how to achieve things, beyond the basic scope of using the software, and donâ€™t allow explanations of concepts or discussions of topics to develop. Instead, link to how-to guides, explanation and introductory tutorials as appropriate.

### Be accurate and up-to-date

These descriptions must be accurate and kept up-to-date. Any discrepancy between the machinery and your description of it will inevitably lead a user astray.
